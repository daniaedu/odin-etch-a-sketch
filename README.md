Project: Etch-a-Sketch

Description:
 This Etch-a-Sketch is a personal project designed to explore the functionalities of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to create interactive drawings on a digital grid, similar to the classic children's toy.

Current Features:
 - Drawing Modes:
    1. Standard Mode: Fill squares with classic black color.
    2. Rainbow Mode: Each click generates a random color for the selected square.
 - Eraser: Remove previously drawn lines and colors for a clean slate.
 - Reset Button: Clear the entire drawing and return to the initial state.
- Grid Size Adjustment: Dynamically change the grid size using a slider or range input.

Planned Improvements (For Future Exploration):
 - Grid Size Labels: Integrate numeric labels alongside the slider to visually indicate the chosen grid size.
 - Hold-to-Fill Functionality: Allow users to continuously fill squares with the chosen color as long as they hold down the mouse button while dragging.
 - Enhanced Visual Elements (Optional): Implement CSS animations, effects, or creative layouts to make the drawing process more visually engaging.

Technologies Used:
 1. HTML (Structure)
 2. CSS (Styling)
 3. JavaScript (Functionality)
